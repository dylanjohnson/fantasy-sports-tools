  As a user
  I need pseudo-positions

  Scenario: Pseudo-positions should have one or more player positions

  Scenario: Players should not have pseudo-positions

  Scenario: Only pseudo-positions should have includes

  Scenario: Pseudo-positions should not be able to include other pseudo-positions
